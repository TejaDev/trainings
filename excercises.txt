# Simple math - solve

8 * 15 + 4
1.0 - 2.5 * 3
0.5^2 - 10/2
x^2 - 25 = 0

# Strings

- Create four labels: name, surname, age, country and assign your personal information
- print this information as:

a) "NAME SURNAME"
b) "NAME SURNAME from COUNTRY"
c) "NAME - AGE"


# Lists
Create following lists:

- List A: numbers from 0 to 100, hint: help(range)
- List B: only even numbers from list A
- List C: numbers from list A sorted in descent order
- List D: all numbers from list B should be squared (number ^ 2)
- List E: only numbers from 20 to 60 from list A
- List F: only numbers from 100 to 70 from list A
- List G: sum of list E and F
- List H: list G plus number 1000
- List I: copy of list H
- List J: from list H remove smallest number
- List K: list H extended with list ['A', 'B', 'C']

Create following variables:
- v1: sum of numbers from list B
- v2: maximum number from list H
- v3: minimum number from list H
- v4: average number from list G

# Dictionaries

Create three dictionaries that will contain following information from premier league table:

postion, club, played, won, drawn, lost, points
1	Leicester City	    25	15	8	2	53
2   Tottenham Hotspur	25	13	9	3	48
3	Arsenal	            25	14	6	5	48 

1) print each dictionary in given order as you have in premier league table: postion, club, played, won, drawn, lost, points
expected output:
1 - Leicester City - 25 - 15 - 8 - 2 - 53
2 - Tottenham Hotspur - 25 - 13 - 9 - 3 - 48
3 - Arsenal	- 25 - 14 - 6 - 5 - 48 

2) create list PREMIER_LEAGUE_POINTS and put these three dictionaries inside this list
and then sort by club points (Leicester should be first on this list)


# Control flow

IMPORTANT: You should use PREMIER_LEAGUE_POINTS list created in previous exercise

- from PREMIER_LEAGUE_POINTS select clubs with losts number not higher than 3 (lost <= 3) and print its names
expected output: ["Leicester City", "Tottenham Hotspur"]

- create new list of dictionaries CLUB_POINTS from PREMIER_LEAGUE_POINTS, new dictionary should contain only
club name and points number
expected output: [{'Leicester City': 53}, {'Tottenham Hotspur': 48}, {'Arsenal': 48}]

- from CLUB_POINTS dictionary create list of tuples with fields (club, points)
expected output: [('Leicester City', 53), ('Tottenham Hotspur', 48), ('Arsenal', 48)]


# Functions_1
Create a function “VAT_price_calculator” that calculates the total price of a product.
- The formula for calculating the price is: price + price * VAT%. 
- The function will receive the price as parameter. 
- VAT will be a global variable.  
- Set variable VAT with value 0.24 
 


# Functions_2
Create function that will generate random string (pseudo password) of size N.
Our password should contains upper and lower letters + digits + special characters (only . , : are allowed)

Hint:
module "string" - https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html
module "random" - https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html

Example:

def generate_password(length):
	# CODE HERE
	
password = generate_password(5)
print(password)  # should return 1A.c9


# Files


1. create random.dat file - to file insert random string of size 512 characters
hint: you can import function generate_password(512) created previously


2. from random.dat file read:
- all NUMBERS to list NUMBERS_LIST
- all LETTERS to list LETTERS_LIST


3. create unique_data.dat file that will contain unique data from random.dat file
- unique means without repetition (order does not matter), for example:

random.dat ----
AbbA1100234
-----
unique_data.dat ---
Ab10234
---


# Classes

1. Create class PremierLeagueClub with following attributes: postion, club, played, won, drawn, lost, points
2. class should have following methods:
    - get_points() - to recalculate points use formula (won * 3 + drawn)
	- get_games_played() - use formula (won + drawn + lost)
	- get_magic_formula() should return played multiplyed by points, e.g: (played * points)
	- get_info() - should return string with all club information joined by '-' e.g: "1 - Leicester City - 25 - 15 - 8 - 2 - 53"
	- set_won_game() - should update played, won and points - 
	- set_lost_game() - should update played, lost

3. You should be able to sort PremierLeague objects by magic_fomula score


Example

arsenal = PremierLeagueClub(postion=3, club="Arsenal", won=14, drawn=6, lost=5)
arsenal.get_games_played() # should return 25
arsenal.get_points()       # should return 48

arsenal.set_lost_game()

arsenal.get_games_played() # should return 26
arsenal.get_points()       # should return 48


arsenal.set_won_game()

arsenal.get_games_played() # should return 27
arsenal.get_points()       # should return 51
