# Lists
Create following lists:

- List A: numbers from 0 to 100, hint: help(range)
- List B: only even numbers from list A
- List C: numbers from list A sorted in descent order
- List D: all numbers from list B should be squared (number ^ 2)
- List E: only numbers from 20 to 60 from list A
- List F: only numbers from 100 to 70 from list A (reverse order)
- List G: sum of list E and F
- List H: list G plus number 1000 (append number 1000 only to list H)
- List I: copy of list H
- List J: from list H remove smallest number
- List K: list H extended with list ['A', 'B', 'C']

Create following variables:
- v1: sum of numbers from list B
- v2: maximum number from list H
- v3: minimum number from list H
- v4: average number from list G

# Dictionaries

Create three dictionaries that will contain following information from premier league table:

postion, club, played, won, drawn, lost, points
1	Leicester City	    25	15	8	2	53
2   Tottenham Hotspur	25	13	9	3	48
3	Arsenal	            25	14	6	5	48 

1) print each dictionary in given order as you have in premier league table: postion, club, played, won, drawn, lost, points
expected output:
1 - Leicester City - 25 - 15 - 8 - 2 - 53
2 - Tottenham Hotspur - 25 - 13 - 9 - 3 - 48
3 - Arsenal	- 25 - 14 - 6 - 5 - 48 

2) create list PREMIER_LEAGUE_POINTS and put these three dictionaries inside this list
	

# Control flow 1

Write a program that asks the user to provide numbers.
If total sum of all provided number is higher than 100 you can stop program.


You can write two versions of this program: in interactive mode or in script mode.


# Control flow 2


IMPORTANT: You should use PREMIER_LEAGUE_POINTS list created in previous exercise

- from PREMIER_LEAGUE_POINTS select clubs with losts number not higher than 3 (lost <= 3) and print its names
expected output: "Leicester City", "Tottenham Hotspur"

- create new list of dictionaries CLUB_POINTS from PREMIER_LEAGUE_POINTS, new dictionary should contain only
club name and points number
expected output: [{'Leicester City': 53}, {'Tottenham Hotspur': 48}, {'Arsenal': 48}]


# Functions_1
Create a function tax_price_calculator that calculates the total price of a product.
- The formula for calculating the price is: price + price * TAX%. 
- The function will receive the price and tax as parameter. 

Run this function as follows:
tax_price_calculator(30)
tax_price_calculator(30, tax=2)


# Functions_2
Create function that will generate random string (pseudo password) of size N.
Our password should contains upper and lower letters + digits + special characters (only . , : are allowed)

Hint:
module "string" - https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html
module "random" - https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html


# Functions_3
Calculating Fibonacci Series upto n numbers.

In fibonacci series, next number is the sum of previous two numbers for example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc.
The first two numbers of fibonacci series are 0 and 1.

Ask the user to provide numbers limit.


Example:

def generate_password(length):
	# CODE HERE
	
password = generate_password(5)
print(password)  # should return 1A.c9


# Files


1. create random.dat file - to file insert random string of size 512 characters
hint: you can import function generate_password(512) created previously


2. from random.dat file read:
- all NUMBERS to list NUMBERS_LIST
- all LETTERS to list LETTERS_LIST


3. create unique_data.dat file that will contain unique data from random.dat file
- unique means without repetition (order does not matter), for example:

random.dat ----
AbbA1100234
-----
unique_data.dat ---
Ab10234
---


# Classes

1. Create class PremierLeagueClub with following attributes: postion, club, played, won, drawn, lost, points
2. class should have following methods:
    - get_points() - to recalculate points use formula (won * 3 + drawn)
	- get_games_played() - use formula (won + drawn + lost)
	- get_magic_formula() should return played multiplyed by points, e.g: (played * points)
	- get_info() - should return string with all club information joined by '-' e.g: "1 - Leicester City - 25 - 15 - 8 - 2 - 53"
	- set_won_game() - should update played, won and points - 
	- set_lost_game() - should update played, lost

3. You should be able to sort PremierLeague objects by magic_fomula score


Example

arsenal = PremierLeagueClub(postion=3, club="Arsenal", won=14, drawn=6, lost=5)
arsenal.get_games_played() # should return 25
arsenal.get_points()       # should return 48

arsenal.set_lost_game()

arsenal.get_games_played() # should return 26
arsenal.get_points()       # should return 48


arsenal.set_won_game()

arsenal.get_games_played() # should return 27
arsenal.get_points()       # should return 51
